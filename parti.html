                      <h3 class="single_heading_para">Make Researches Easier</h3>
                      <p>The purpose of this project is to help researchers
                        have a more efficient way to find participants for
                        projects. <br><br>

                        Therefore, instead of spending a long time
                        solving trivial problems, they can focus more on project itself.
                         Student researchers often complain about the difficulties of
                         recruiting participants for their peer critique, product usability testing,
                         brainstorm or other user-involved activities.<br><br>
                      After having conversations with several student designers and interview with
                      student developers/researchers, we found that they spend too much time on finding
                      diverse participants outside their friends' circle.<br><br>


                      Therefore, we hope to design an
                      experience to change the current situation so they can be more focused on the project itself.</p>

                      <p>


                        In a team of four, Li, Yisu, Qi and I together conducted literature review, co-design session and transfer scenario.<br><br>
                        Based on the insights we obtained, we decided to create the app called “Parti” to <b>encourage more participation in research and help researchers, especially student researchers and citizen scientists
                        have a more efficient way to recruit participants</b>.<br><br>
                        Everyone participates in each step of the projects from decision making,
                        literature review recruiting participants, co-design, transfer scenario and final design.

                      <h3 class="single_heading_para">Understanding the problem</h3>
                      <p>To understand what pain points users have when recruiting participants. We used two user research methods, <b>co-design and transfer scenario</b>.
                      </p>


                      <h5 class="single_subheading_black" style="margin-top:40px">Co-design</h5>

                      <p>We used co-design as a one of our user research approach to understand users, and to iterate early designs in our project. <br><br>

                        By including all the stakeholders in a student project, which are student designers, developers, and product managers, we want to not only brainstorm ideas of recruiting participants in different scenarios, but also investigate the potentially conflicting concerns of their roles within the team. <br><br>

Additionally, projects and its process of bringing ideas to reality usually involves several stakeholders. There are product managers who usually control the overall timeline, progress, and budget of the project, also make the final call about the decisions; designers and developers who bring ideas to working; and also researchers who are usually in charge of the user research and usability testing. Involving all our potential users together and observing how they handle and design around the possible conflicts can lead us to a more inclusive and innovative design idea. <br><br>

  <h5 class="single_subheading" style="margin-top:40px">1. Preparation</h5>
<p>We prepared the following materials:

</p>
<ul><li>Script about the Participatory Design Instruction</li>
  <li>Consent Form</li>
  <li>Printed Scenario Description</li>
  <li>Computers for taking notes</li>
  <li>Paper & Sharpies & Color Pencils & Scissors for design exercise</li>
</ul>


<h5 class="single_subheading" style="margin-top:40px">2. Procedure</h5>
<ul><li>Do some ice-breaking and get to know each other, we first asked everybody to do a short introduction about who they are, and what kind of role they usually take in the project. Then we gave an introduction about our project and the idea of co-design.</li>
  <li>The second part of the session was providing three scenarios in which they need to recruit participants and we gave them 15 minus for each to discuss the way they would like to approach. The three scenarios were partially funded project team work, no-funding course project and fully funded
    department project. Each scenario has different requirements about the number of
    participants, the depth of insight they need to obtain and also the planned length for recruitment.</li>
  <li>The last part of the session was a 15 minutes design exercise. Participants were asked to turn the challenges they were discussing into design opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="single_subheading" style="margin-top:40px">3. Findings</h5>
<ul><li>Different funding affects the marketing strategy of finding ideal users. While larger amount of funding allows the workshop team to simply give higher reward to attract users but it doesn’t necessarily provide with self-motivation, and thus might result in less insightful results.</li>
  <li>Sampling of the participants poses a challenge. Some of the projects needs a specific participant group.</li>
  <li>During design discussion, when our participants try to include all the scenarios into one solution,
    they express concerns to support projects that are poorly funded and have
    less attractive topics. One suggestion they propose to compensate for those
    disadvantages is more invested marketing on the platform.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="single_subheading_black" style="margin-top:40px">Transfer Scenario</h5>

<p>As we realized we are missing the participant’s view in our co-design, so we decided to use the transfer scenario as our second research method. As we identified that participants for research studies
  are usually with low/no direct rewards, and are
  participating for contribution to academia. So
  when are trying to find the transferable scenarios,
  we are looking for scenarios where have the following characteristics:
  no direct rewards, time-consuming, non-profit, or lack of motivation.</p>

<h5 class="single_subheading" style="margin-top:40px">1. Alternative Scenario</h5>

<p>
Going through several possible scenarios we can think of
and within reach of ourselves, we decided to go for the
following two scenarios: philanthropy activities which people
engage, and selling donuts for club/organization fundraising.

</p>

<h5 class="single_subheading" style="margin-top:40px">2. Goal and Procedure</h5>

<p>
The goal of this research methods is to investigate why
people are willing to engage in philanthropy activities, or willing to
sell donuts for club fundraising. As they won’t be directly benefited
from participating in those events, also they are not forced to participate.
So it can be transferred to our case of people participating in research studies.
We wish to get insights into the motivation of participating in research projects/studies.
To increase our understanding of those scenarios, we began with conversations with
students who had those experiences, thus developed a better understanding of those scenarios.
For philanthropy activities - we chose students from Alpha Phi Omega Gamma Chapter at Cornell University,
a co-ed service fraternity founded on the principles of Leadership, Friendship, and Service; for donut
selling - we chose students who’ve sold donuts for business clubs’ fundraising and Alternative
Spring Break at Cornell.

</p>

<h5 class="single_subheading" style="margin-top:40px">3. Findings</h5>

<p>
  We found out that those students have a personal passion about service which makes them dedicated to the service fraternity. This also applies to donut fundraising, as they have to successfully raise the fund to be continued to stay in the clubs - which is part of their passion. Also, they love the opportunity that philanthropy organizations can provide them - opportunities to connect with a wide range of people and organizations where they won’t have the opportunity if don’t join the service fraternity.<br><br>

  We successfully transfer those findings to our project: 1. allowing users to view their personal interested field is very important, only in this case, they would care less about the compensation and more focused on the topic. 2.Also, we are trying to provide opportunities to let researchers and participants connect with each other in academia after the study is finished - which leads to our concept of project showcase, so they can keep in touch and update the project progress.
